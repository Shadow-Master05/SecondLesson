          <h2>The Greatest Samurai Of All Time</h2>
          <p>
			<b>Miyamoto Musashi (宮本 武蔵, 1584 – 13 June 1645), also known as Shinmen Takezō,
               Miyamoto Bennosuke or, by his Buddhist name, Niten Dōraku, was a Japanese swordsman,
                philosopher, strategist, writer and rōnin, who became renowned through stories of his unique 
                double-bladed swordsmanship and undefeated record in his 61 duels (next is 33 by Itō Ittōsai). 
                Musashi, as he was often simply known, is considered a Kensei, a sword-saint of Japan. He was 
                the founder of the Niten Ichi-ryū, or Nito Ichi-ryū, style of swordsmanship, and in his final years
                 authored The Book of Five Rings (五輪の書, Go Rin No Sho) and Dokkōdō (The Path of Aloneness).<br><br>

                "I have trained in the way of strategy since my youth, and at the age of thirteen I fought a duel for the first time. My opponent was called Arima Kihei, a sword adept of the Shinto ryū, and I defeated him. At the age of sixteen I defeated a powerful adept by the name of Tadashima Akiyama, who came from Tajima Province. At the age of twenty-one I went up to Kyōtō and fought duels with several adepts of the sword from famous schools, but I never lost."
